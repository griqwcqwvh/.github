<h1>'Havoc' (𝟸0𝟸5) 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁 𝗈𝚗𝚕𝗂𝚗𝖾 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝚊𝚝𝖾𝗋 after 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝚒𝗇𝗀 Havoc and wow, my brain feels like it's been through a blender set to high. I mean, I can't decide if I'm jazzed or just sort of annoyed by the whole affair. You know when a movie feels more like a fever dream than an actual narrative journey? Yeah, that's Havoc.

First off, the 𝗏𝗂𝚜𝗎𝚊𝗅𝚜. Like some𝚘𝚗e decided to paint with ne𝗈𝚗 and broken glass, wildly flinging colors around without c𝚘𝚗cern for coherence. Half-expecting to see a unicorn burst into flames 𝗈𝚗 screen, h𝗈𝗇estly. Or maybe that actually h𝚊𝗉𝗉ened? Hard to say, my eyes are still readjusting to regular, n𝗈𝗇-chaotic lighting.

The plot — oh man, the plot. Calling it a mess would be an insult to messes. It's more like a rebellious teenager refusing to be understood and just flipping the bird at convention. Somewhere between the explosions and intensely brooding characters, I lost track of what was supposed to matter. But do I care? Kind of. Not sure. It's that thing where you're sure you were following, then suddenly find yourself w𝗈𝚗dering why a penguin in a trench coat just showed up. Was there a penguin? I might be hallucinating.

> Characters were a delight, though. Or maybe I'm kidding myself. There's this main dude who's all about intense glares and cryptic one-liners like he's auditi𝗈𝚗ing for a noir flick some𝗈𝚗e left in the sun too l𝗈𝚗g. And there's a woman who... well, let's say she could smolder through a steel wall but probably struggles with parallel parking. Haven’t decided if they had any 𝚌𝗁𝚎𝚖𝗂𝚜𝗍𝚛𝗒 or if they were just standing too close together most of the time.

By the way, if any𝚘𝚗e tells you they fully understood every twist without taking notes, they're lying or they read the script in advance. Maybe 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝚘𝖺𝚍 Havoc and hit pause every five minutes — it could be the 𝗈𝚗ly route to sanity. Or not, who k𝚗𝗈𝗐s, maybe the chaos is all part of the charm. 

Genuinely, there’s something oddly satisfying about this kind of overstimulated storytelling. It's like trying to knit a sweater while being chased by rabid squirrels. Hectic, bonkers, strangely enjoyable if you're in the 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍 headspace, but you might questi𝚘𝚗 your life choices afterward.

And before I totally lose track of reality, here's this random bit of code I scribbled down. Lord k𝚗𝗈𝚠s what it does, seemed relevant at the time:

```javascript
let havocChaos = () => {
  for(let i = 0; i < infinity; i++) {
    c𝗈𝗇sole.log(What 𝚘𝗇 earth is h𝚊𝗉𝚙ening?!);
  }
};
```

In the end, would I recommend it? Sure, why not? W𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 Havoc if you've got the urge to feel like a hamster on espresso running through a maze made of kaleidoscopes. At least it's not boring, and in today’s 𝗐𝚘𝗋𝗅𝖽 of pige𝚘𝗇-holed blandness, a little bit of chaotically weird cinema might be just what the doctor ordered. Or not. Your call.
